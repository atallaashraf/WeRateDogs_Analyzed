# WeRateDogs_Analyzed
Collect and Analyze WeRateDog data from Twitter

In this project, I'll be using Tweepy to query Twitter's API for data included in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. 
This data will include retweet count and favorite count. Before I can run my API querying code, I need to set 
up my own Twitter application. Once I have this set up, I will develop some code to create an API object that 
I'll use to gather Twitter data. After querying each tweet ID, I will write its JSON data to a tweet_json.txt file 
with each tweet's JSON data on its own line. I will then read this file, line by line, to create a pandas DataFrame 
that I will assess and clean. I may post this completed project on my GitHub account, where it will get viewers.
Otherwise there will be no other readers or users of my Twitter data or project analysis beyond the Udacity 
instructors and reviewers.
